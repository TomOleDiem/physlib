# Pauli decomposition of qubit observables

Every element of a qubit observable algebra decomposes uniquely as `c₀ 1 + c₁ gen 0 + c₂ gen 1
+ c₃ gen 2` with complex coefficients — this is immediate from `QubitAlgebra.pauliBasis` being a
basis, not a separate theorem. What is not immediate: an element is self-adjoint exactly when
all four coefficients are real, and consequently every *observable* (not just every algebra
element) coordinatizes as a real scalar part plus a Pauli vector, giving a real-linear
equivalence `Observable A ≃ₗ[ℝ] ℝ × (Fin 3 → ℝ)`, `(a₀, v) ↦ a₀ • 1 + σ v`.

This equivalence is the primary coordinate system for qubit observables: the traceless/non-scalar
sector is naturally `Fin 3 → ℝ`, and downstream sections (states, positivity, dynamics) are
built on top of it rather than on the four raw complex coefficients.

normalization `trace (1 : A) = 2`, `trace (gen i : A) = 0` — the trace of a `2 × 2` identity and

`QubitAlgebra.pauliBasis` being a basis. -/

determinant once `Qubit/Matrix.lean` identifies `A` with `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ`, is not
needed below and not yet checked.) -/
